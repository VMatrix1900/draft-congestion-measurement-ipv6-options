                IPv6 Options for Congestion Measurement
       draft-shi-ippm-congestion-measurement-ipv6-options-latest

Abstract

   The Congestion Measurement enables precise congestion control,
   assists in effective load balancing, and simplifies network debugging
   by accurately reflecting the degree of congestion across network
   paths.  This document defines how Congestion Measurement Data Fields
   are encapsulated in IPv6.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.draft-shi-ippm-congestion-measurement-data] introduces data
   fields of Congestion Measurement which enables sender to obtain the
   degree of congestion across the path.  This document defines the IPv6
   encapsulation of the Congestion Measurement Data Fields.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Congestion Measurement Option

   The Congestion Measurement IPv6 Option is defined to carry the
   Congestion Measurement Data-Fields.

    0                   1                   2                   3

                                   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                                   |Opt Type = TBD1|  Opt Data Len |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                                                               |
   .                                                               .
   .        Congestion Measurement Data-Fields (Variable)          .

   |                                                               |

                Figure 1: Congestion Measurement IPv6 Option

   where:

   *  Opt Type: Type value is TBD1, an 8-bit unsigned integer.
      Identifier of the type of this Congestion Measurement Option.

   *  Opt Data Len: An 8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the Option
      Data field of this option, that is, the length of the Congestion
      Measurement Data-Fields.

   *  Congestion Measurement Data-Fields: Option-Type-specific data.  It
      carries the data fields for Congestion Measurement as specified in
      [I-D.draft-shi-ippm-congestion-measurement-data].

2.1.  Congestion Measurement Hop-by-hop Options Header (HBH)

   The Congestion Measurement option can be carried in the IPv6 Hop-by-
   Hop Options Header.  In this case, each node along the path can
   inspect the Congestion Info Data field if they are configured to
   support this option.  If the U bit of Congestion Measurement Data-
   Fields is set, intermediate nodes will modify the Congestion Info
   Data field accordingly.  In theory, the presence of the Hop-by-Hop
   Option should not affect the traffic throughput both on nodes that do
   not recognize this Option and on the nodes that support it.  However,
   in a real implementation, a packet with a Hop-by-hop Option may be
   skipped or processed in the slow path.  Proposals to mitigate the
   problem are out of the scope for this document.

2.2.  Congestion Measurement Destination Options Header (DOH)

   The Congestion Measurement option can be carried in the IPv6
   Destination Options Header.  In this case, it is usually processed by
   the destination node.  Note that, if there is also a Routing Header
   (RH), any visited destination in the route list can process it.  If
   the U bit of Congestion Measurement Data-Fields is set, intermediate
   nodes that are in the route list will modify the Congestion Info Data
   field accordingly.

3.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of the Congestion Measurement are
   discussed in [I-D.draft-shi-ippm-congestion-measurement-data].

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign an IPv6 Option from the "Destination
   Options and Hop-by-Hop Options" subregistry of "Internet Protocol
   Version 6 (IPv6) Parameters (https://www.iana.org/assignments/
   ipv6-parameters/)" as follows:

           +=======+===============================+===========+
           | Value | Description                   | Reference |
           +=======+===============================+===========+
           | TBD1  | Congestion Measurement Option | Section 2 |
           +-------+-------------------------------+-----------+
